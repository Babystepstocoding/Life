# Conway's Game of Life _in Haskell_
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
